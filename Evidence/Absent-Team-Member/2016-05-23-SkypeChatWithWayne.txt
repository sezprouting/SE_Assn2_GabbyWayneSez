[23/05/16 9:04:58 pm] Sarah Prouting: @Wayne I hope you will join us again - We thought perhaps you could write a learning package. Gabby is organising and writing the guide for the tools which will support the project. You could chat with her about which one would be best to work on :-)

[23/05/16 9:40:51 pm] yi wu: :$thanks you guys give me the chance   , I will take some work for the project ,and do my best to catch up with what

[23/05/16 9:41:44 pm] Sarah Prouting: I was just worried that something had happened!

[23/05/16 9:42:41 pm] Sarah Prouting: I am meeting with Jim tomorrow to talk about the project, itâ€™s at 1:30.
Unfortunately Gabby has a class but it would be great if you can come - can you make it?

[23/05/16 9:44:46 pm] yi wu: yes I will come

[23/05/16 9:47:51 pm] Sarah Prouting: Thatâ€™s great!

[23/05/16 9:56:25 pm] Sarah Prouting: Hi Wayne :-)
I asked Jim to try and find you, because I was texting and calling you to try and work together but I couldnâ€™t find you.
We really want you to help us with the assignment, because we canâ€™t do it with just Gabby and I.
Maybe you and I can work together in the library this week?

[23/05/16 10:10:29 pm] yi wu: :$.  Cool , thanks a lot ! That's great

[23/05/16 10:11:21 pm] Sarah Prouting: Okay - how about we arrange something after meeting with Jim tomorrow? 
Will we see you in the tutorial as well?

[23/05/16 10:11:41 pm] yi wu: OK

[23/05/16 10:12:12 pm] yi wu: see you tomorrr

[23/05/16 10:31:00 pm] Sarah Prouting: See you then ðŸ˜Š
