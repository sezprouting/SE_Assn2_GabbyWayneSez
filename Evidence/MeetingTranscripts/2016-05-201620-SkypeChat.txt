[20/05/16 4:21:36 pm] Sarah Prouting: Team - lets go with Crystal, since I havenâ€™t really heard otherwise.

[20/05/16 4:22:32 pm] Sarah Prouting: We had originally planned a sprint from last Monday to today, and we were supposed to finish the Practice Guide today - we havenâ€™t even started it!!

[20/05/16 4:23:18 pm] Sarah Prouting: SO we need to make this decision:
1) when will our next sprint start and end?
2) What is the goal?

[20/05/16 4:23:38 pm] Sarah Prouting: Can we make this decision by the end of tonight please?

[20/05/16 10:19:47 pm] Gabby: Next Saturday night 
Practice guide on crystal and my research on strum

[20/05/16 11:03:28 pm] Sarah Prouting: Do you mean tomorrow night, 21 may?

[20/05/16 11:03:39 pm] Gabby: Next not tomorrow

[20/05/16 11:04:20 pm] Sarah Prouting: Next Saturday will be 28 may. Project is due on 27th.

[20/05/16 11:24:35 pm] Gabby: Oh .. Really?

[20/05/16 11:24:40 pm] Gabby: So tomorrow will do

[20/05/16 11:24:44 pm] Gabby: I'll try my best

[20/05/16 11:25:43 pm] Sarah Prouting: How about Sunday night? I am volunteering with omgTech for most of tomorrow, so would appreciate Sunday to work on it too.

[20/05/16 11:26:01 pm] Gabby: Okay sure Sunday then

[20/05/16 11:27:25 pm] Sarah Prouting: Okay. How about we each post our 3 questions tomorrow night, and hold a meeting on Sunday night to review what has been done & what needs to happen next? Say... 5pm on Sunday?

[20/05/16 11:28:28 pm] Gabby: Sure I'll try and ah I don't sure about 5pm will see if I can or not. But will let you know by then

[20/05/16 11:28:47 pm] Sarah Prouting: What would be a better time on Sunday?

[20/05/16 11:29:24 pm] Gabby: I don't sure. But for now 5.30pm

[20/05/16 11:30:21 pm] Sarah Prouting: Okay, I'll expect 5:30 unless you tell me otherwise :-)
Just give me a bit of notice if you do need to change it ðŸ˜Š

[20/05/16 11:36:45 pm] Gabby: Sure
