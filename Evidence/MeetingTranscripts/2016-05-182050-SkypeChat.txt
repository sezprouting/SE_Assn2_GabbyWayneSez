[18/05/16 8:48:59 am] Sarah Prouting: Good morning team! Time is ticking on! My choice for the next Sprint would also to be choose one out of Crystal, Scrum or XP.
[18/05/16 8:49:09 am] Sarah Prouting: Wayne - what do you think?
[18/05/16 6:39:57 pm] Sarah Prouting: Okay, Since we haven’t heard from Wayne - how about we make a couple of decisions Gabby?
1. Which method shall we recommend, and 
2. Shall we try to finish the practice guide by Friday, or change the way tho new sprint runs?
[18/05/16 6:40:43 pm] Sarah Prouting: @Wayne - I hope you are able to take part!
[18/05/16 7:04:04 pm] Gabby: I don't sure, as seeing the time, I guess we should be able to take your recommend
[18/05/16 7:04:16 pm] Gabby: And yeah try our best
[18/05/16 7:05:35 pm] Sarah Prouting: What about Scrum though - you researched that eh? What did you think about it - would it work for the Game project?
[18/05/16 7:08:25 pm] Gabby: I have read the draft report on google drive, it's all look ready up and perfectly so I think it's that.
[18/05/16 7:08:37 pm] Gabby: And scrum is similar to agile
[18/05/16 7:10:40 pm] Sarah Prouting: okay… well Crystal lets us use techniques from any other methodology, so we could use some scrum techniques!
For example, what have you found from Scrum which would enable the company to manage requirements?
[18/05/16 7:38:26 pm] Gabby: Oh so you want to have more methods in the report?
[18/05/16 7:39:04 pm] Sarah Prouting: Hmmm… I am thinking of the best way to share what is in my head!
[18/05/16 7:45:17 pm] Sarah Prouting: First, I was thinking that we would all write about our chosen method - so in the Approach section we would have a summary, advantages and disadvantages three times (once each for scrum, xp and crystal) then at the end of that section we would pick one and say THIS is the one we recommend. Then the rest of the report would be about the approach we picked out of the three.

BUT

You said you were happy to recommend Crystal. Well crystal says we can choose any technique that meets the standards… so we could suggest a daily standup (from scrum) and recommend it as a communication practice, and we could also suggest something  from XP or Kanban one recommend it as a Requirements or Quality Assurance practice guide.

So either one of the above two paragraphs could work.
[18/05/16 7:46:48 pm] Sarah Prouting: Tho second paragraph, that suggestion, it means we can just write about Crystal in the first section and recommend the other methods as sections or parts of the Crystal approach. Does that make sense?
[18/05/16 7:51:04 pm] Gabby: Yeah
[18/05/16 7:51:25 pm] Gabby: First paragraph will require all of ours researchs on a day
[18/05/16 7:51:39 pm] Sarah Prouting: yes
[18/05/16 7:52:03 pm] Gabby: So if Wayne happy about it so I'll happy with it
[18/05/16 7:53:46 pm] Sarah Prouting: With using the first suggestion - to add your work and Wayne’s work to the first section and then recommend one of the three?
[18/05/16 7:55:16 pm] Gabby: Yeah but need to specific on what day to be completed on this all of three suggestions
[18/05/16 7:56:55 pm] Sarah Prouting: Well… that was supposed to happen last Sunday :-(
[18/05/16 7:57:45 pm] Gabby: I see so... change date or go for one method?
[18/05/16 7:59:05 pm] Sarah Prouting: I think so. But without Wayne we might only have Scrum or Crystal to choose from...
[18/05/16 7:59:50 pm] Sarah Prouting: I sent that email yesterday but he hasn’t replied :-( Maybe I should try calling  him
[18/05/16 8:00:11 pm] Gabby: Oh I see. What happen to him? He don't want to continue?
[18/05/16 8:00:47 pm] Sarah Prouting: I don’t know Gabby. I hope he’s okay. I wonder if he lost motivation too.
[18/05/16 8:01:18 pm] Gabby: I see okay
[18/05/16 8:03:25 pm] Sarah Prouting: calling him now…
[18/05/16 8:04:34 pm] Sarah Prouting: It went to voice mail, so I left a message.
[18/05/16 8:06:36 pm] Gabby: Okay sweet
[18/05/16 8:06:57 pm] Gabby: I'm putting everything together hopefully have it done by tomorrow
[18/05/16 8:07:32 pm] Sarah Prouting: Okay, that sounds great. Hopefully we will have heard from Wayne by then!!
[18/05/16 8:14:09 pm] Gabby: Yeah
[18/05/16 8:27:27 pm] Sarah Prouting: If Wayne doesn’t get back to us by tomorrow I think we will just have to continue without him - because we don’t have time to wait much longer.
[18/05/16 8:47:06 pm] Gabby: I see ok
[18/05/16 9:14:15 pm] Sarah Prouting: I'll contact Jim about it tomorrow and see if we can make sure he's okay.
[18/05/16 9:37:28 pm] Gabby: Sure sweet
