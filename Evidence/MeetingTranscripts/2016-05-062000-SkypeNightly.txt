[6/05/16 8:03:50 pm] Sarah Prouting: Hi, is everyone here?

[6/05/16 8:06:25 pm] Sarah Prouting: I won’t be able to meet outside the time box today team, so please respond as soon as you can!

[6/05/16 8:19:12 pm] Sarah Prouting: Okay, with just over 10 minutes to go I will answer my own three questions:

[6/05/16 8:22:17 pm] Sarah Prouting: What I have done I have not made a lot of progress today due to my obstacle.

What I will have completed by the next meeting I will finish the introduction & make a start on writing up my findings from crystal

Obstacles in my path I had a computer melt-down and have had to reinstall my operating system. I still have all my data so it’s not the end of the world but it is time consuming to get everything (including all the software development programs) working again.

[6/05/16 8:30:42 pm] Sarah Prouting: I have to say, I am pretty gutted guys!
We agreed to meet at 8pm for our nightly stands, and we agreed (it’s written in the team agreement) to communicate if we can’t make it to a meeting.

[6/05/16 8:31:39 pm] Sarah Prouting: I do hope that at the least you will post your answers to the three questions by the end of the night - it is important to be aware of what the rest of the team is experiencing.




[7/05/16 11:01:31 am] Gabby: What I have done: haven't made any progress.
What I will have completed by the next meeting: i can't make to tonight meeting and tomorrow due to events. But I'll ensure I made any progress soon as I can.
Obstacles in my path: other assignment, need to be completed. Will resume back normally after this.
