[3/05/16 7:50:25 pm] Gabby: Okay great. Also let you both know that I'll go out for a while to pick something up from 8. I'll still try my best to reply back whenever I can, using data. You can continue discuss what to pick. I haven't decided what to pick yet.
[3/05/16 8:04:04 pm] Sarah Prouting: I think first we should do our scrum meeting - remember it consists of three questions which we each answer - if we have any time left over we can use that to settle on whether to use google docs or one drive… or something else!
[3/05/16 8:15:58 pm] Sarah Prouting: Wayne are you there?
[3/05/16 8:16:21 pm] yi wu: Yes  I'm online
[3/05/16 8:16:52 pm] Sarah Prouting: great! Do you want to take the lead for this meeting and have a go at being the chairman?
[3/05/16 8:18:14 pm] yi wu: Me, I can't take this ,pass me please
[3/05/16 8:18:57 pm] Sarah Prouting: Sure you can! I’ll coach you through if you like?
[3/05/16 8:19:14 pm] Sarah Prouting: You can’t go wrong :-)
[3/05/16 8:19:20 pm] yi wu: :(
[3/05/16 8:20:18 pm] Sarah Prouting: You’ll be fine :-)
First thing to think about is what are our three questions;
Then who do you want to answer first
then ask!
[3/05/16 8:20:47 pm] yi wu: What is the three questions ?
[3/05/16 8:22:21 pm] Sarah Prouting: Good question! They are the three questions for a scrum daily stand-up and they are the only reason for this meeting!
I think there is a copy of them in the Work Approach on our wiki - let’s see if we can find them
[3/05/16 8:24:28 pm] yi wu: I find it on the wiki.
[3/05/16 8:25:21 pm] Sarah Prouting: You’ve found them?
[3/05/16 8:27:26 pm] yi wu: Is this ?
[3/05/16 8:29:25 pm] Sarah Prouting: Sure is! So, as the chairman of the meeting, you get to decide how to ask the questions - (for example will you ask all three at once or one at a time?) and you decide who to ask. You could even lead by starting with yourself. It is all up to you - you are in charge of the meeting :-)
[3/05/16 8:31:34 pm] yi wu: (cwl)
[3/05/16 8:33:51 pm] yi wu: I think we already decided the short daily meeting, every day from the 8or 8:30 . And each time will around 30minutes
[3/05/16 8:34:39 pm] yi wu: What you think
[3/05/16 8:36:25 pm] Sarah Prouting: Yeah - that’s right!
Er… but we might have miscommunicated a little!
In the screen shot which you sent through there is a title called “Short Daily Meetings” and under that title we talk about what the meetings are about, right?
[3/05/16 8:38:13 pm] yi wu: Oh. Got it
[3/05/16 8:38:52 pm] yi wu: "What you have done "like this?
[3/05/16 8:39:53 pm] Sarah Prouting: Yep! That’s the first of the three questions! So your job (tonight anyway) is to make sure all three of us answer each of those questions
[3/05/16 8:40:23 pm] Sarah Prouting: AND make sure we don’t get sidetracked talking about other stuff :-)
[3/05/16 8:45:12 pm] yi wu: This afternoon I did some research, I prefer to take "planing and tracking " this part , as you know each section look like a challenge for me ,so I just want find the most interesting part  to do the research, but I haven't decide it . How about you Sarah
[3/05/16 8:46:44 pm] yi wu: Tomorrow I will continue to work on this part
[3/05/16 8:50:35 pm] Sarah Prouting: Cool! Today I wrote all of the headings (as per the Trello cards and work breakdown) into a google doc and shared it with the team. It’s okay if we end up using word online because I will just cut and paste.

By the next meeting I will have chosen a card and begun my research.
[3/05/16 8:56:18 pm] yi wu: Cool,Sarah for this Friday what part should be finished?
[3/05/16 9:00:13 pm] Sarah Prouting: Hmmm… I think we should change that deadline. Gabby and I agreed to sprint for 5 days which would mean this sprint ends on Sunday. What do you think?
[3/05/16 9:07:17 pm] Sarah Prouting: Okay… well I think we can say our time box is well and truly over, can’t we?!  We got properly started at around half past eight, and now it’s 9 o’clock!
[3/05/16 9:08:31 pm] Sarah Prouting: Gabby - perhaps you could send through your answers once you are home?
And we might need to arrange another meeting (during the day?) tomorrow to try and answer Wayne’s question.
[3/05/16 9:09:39 pm] yi wu: I'm okay with that.
[3/05/16 9:13:50 pm] Sarah Prouting: great! Do you have any idea of a good time to address the deadline & it’s goal tomorrow? How about about 2pm, or a little after?
[3/05/16 9:16:41 pm] yi wu: Little is better for me I got class at 2pm
[3/05/16 9:18:32 pm] Sarah Prouting: later? how about 4? Maybe each of us can think of an answer about: “What is our sprint goal” and “what date should we move Friday’s deadline to?” 
Hopefully that will make the meeting go faster - because we well already have suggestions!
[3/05/16 9:19:08 pm] yi wu: Okay
[3/05/16 9:19:16 pm] yi wu: 4pm
[3/05/16 9:19:49 pm] Sarah Prouting: Yaaay!
[3/05/16 9:20:20 pm] Sarah Prouting: See you then!  I hope you can make it too Gabby!  Just post through your information when you can!
[3/05/16 9:20:24 pm] Sarah Prouting: ciao!!!
[3/05/16 10:51:28 pm] Gabby: Sweet! I'll try make to it as I will finish my class at 4pm! I'll pick some tasks up by tomorrow. :)
