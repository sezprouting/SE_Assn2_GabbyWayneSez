Take a look in Trello, I have added a card in the 'Done' list, it's called "Definition of Done" and I copied and pasted the definition from our team agreement into that card. I also put some notes on how to review it (as we discussed in the tutorial yesterday)\
\
[4/05/16 7:10:07 am] Sarah Prouting: Also, there is a card at the top of the 'Sprint Backlog' list and it is called "Sprint Goal"\
We need to come up with a sprint goal at the 4 o'clock meeting today so have a think about it now :-) Be ready with an idea at 4 !!!\
