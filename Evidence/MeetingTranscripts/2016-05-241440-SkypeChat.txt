[24/05/16 2:40:41 pm] Sarah Prouting: Hi Gabby,
Wayne and I are working together in the library at the moment, if you’re free we could have a chat about the outcome of the meeting with Jim… otherwise it will have to be tonight.

[24/05/16 2:43:16 pm] Sarah Prouting: For example we will do one more sprint but we REALLY NEED to meet in person for the final retrospective on Friday. 
We have to hold a final retrospective to show we are following agile/scrum practices during our project. 

Jim said this can be the final Retrospective which we have to hand in.

[24/05/16 2:43:50 pm] Sarah Prouting: Will you be able to book an interpreter and meet with us on Friday?

[24/05/16 2:47:39 pm] Gabby: Tonight will be fine

[24/05/16 2:48:00 pm] Gabby: Why need to be meet in person?

[24/05/16 2:52:04 pm] Sarah Prouting: That’s great that tonight is good here is what we will need to do:
1 - discuss outcome of meeting with Jim,
2 - communicate and decide on the practices and tools which we will be writing about
3 - make sure we are all clear about the goals of this sprint.

[24/05/16 2:55:13 pm] Sarah Prouting: We need to meet in person on Friday (if possible) because we will have to start AND finish the team retrospective. We don’t have time to do this over Skype. 

It will be faster, and we will get a LOT more out of it if we can be face-to-face. Remember face-to-face communication is a big part of the agile philosophy.

[24/05/16 2:56:08 pm] Sarah Prouting: It’s understandable that we haven’t really been able to do it for most of the project but doing it at the end, for the retrospective, will make sure we make a strong finish to our project.

[24/05/16 3:05:13 pm] Gabby: I don't sure if I will be able to book an interpreter for this Friday as most interpreters have been booked prior

[24/05/16 3:05:39 pm] Gabby: And what time for this Friday?

[24/05/16 3:19:33 pm] Sarah Prouting: For tonight - how does 9:30 sound?
For Friday - I have a tutorial from 10 - 1pm but the retrospective is my main priority so I will come whatever the time. Wayne has just left so I’m not sure what time he can make it.

[24/05/16 3:20:44 pm] Sarah Prouting: It would be great if there is an interpreter free, but if there isn’t then we can look at other options - I would rather use Skype while sitting next to each other than skyping from a distance…

[24/05/16 3:40:38 pm] Gabby: Sure. 

Oh well, I will see if I can make it and I have a lab from 4 till 6.

[24/05/16 4:50:03 pm] Sarah Prouting: Okay, how about you see if you can book an interpreter for any time on Friday and we'll go from there.

[24/05/16 4:50:28 pm] Sarah Prouting: Wayne - when are your classes on Friday?
