[10/05/16 3:38:35 pm] Sarah Prouting: So... the output of our retrospective!! 
1. @rainyriver11: Do you think we have set priorities, or shall we follow this up with another meeting?

[10/05/16 3:43:43 pm] Gabby: There are priorities?

[10/05/16 3:44:13 pm] Sarah Prouting: Haha, not sure! What do you think?

[10/05/16 3:45:33 pm] Gabby: I think for now, the approval of one approach for the main report is one of the priorities?

[10/05/16 3:47:39 pm] Sarah Prouting: Yes I agree. I believe this is essential to deciding what methods/practices we will then recommend to achieve the ‘approach’
Do you want to take the time (as a team) to establish the rest of the priorities?

[10/05/16 3:54:05 pm] Gabby: The time?

[10/05/16 3:57:53 pm] Sarah Prouting: I’m sorry, I will ask a slightly different way:
Do you want the team to arrange a meeting to establish the rest of the priorities?

[10/05/16 4:01:27 pm] Gabby: It's okay. I don't sure about that.

[10/05/16 4:04:57 pm] Sarah Prouting: Shall we go over the priorities again at the next retrospective?

[10/05/16 4:05:29 pm] Gabby: When is the next retrospective?

[10/05/16 4:05:58 pm] Sarah Prouting: It would be after Sprint #2

[10/05/16 4:06:15 pm] Gabby: Is it like next week?

[10/05/16 4:08:00 pm] Sarah Prouting: shall I send a picture of the ‘merged’ calendar which Wayne and I finished after the tutorial? It shows the way we combined the individual ideas for milestones.
It still needs group consensus - which means your approval (so there’s still time to change/adjust it)

[10/05/16 4:08:25 pm] Sarah Prouting: That gives an ideas of when we think the sprints will be

[10/05/16 4:08:49 pm] Gabby: Okay

[10/05/16 4:09:34 pm] Sarah Prouting: Image

[10/05/16 4:10:05 pm] Sarah Prouting: At the moment - we have a sprint planned for 10 - 15 May (today to Sunday). My next question was whether we were all hay to commit to this.

[10/05/16 4:10:15 pm] Sarah Prouting: hay = happy!

[10/05/16 4:22:43 pm] Gabby: After sprint meant after 15 May?

[10/05/16 4:24:36 pm] Sarah Prouting: yeah… we’d have to squeeze it in there between the end of Sprint #2 and the start of Sprint #3. Keep in mind that the retrospective may result in changes to this calendar - nothing is set in stone.
(Especially since we haven’t officially agreed on it yet)

[10/05/16 4:26:42 pm] Gabby: I see okay. 15th will do

[10/05/16 4:28:30 pm] Sarah Prouting: Cool! So that makes sprint #2 from 10 - 15 May. Happy?

[10/05/16 4:32:03 pm] Gabby: Yep ok

[10/05/16 4:34:07 pm] Sarah Prouting: And I took the goal straight out of the assignment deliverables “Recommendation for project Approach”

[10/05/16 4:41:00 pm] Gabby: From where? Trello?

[10/05/16 4:41:43 pm] Sarah Prouting: From the assignment...

[10/05/16 4:42:13 pm] Sarah Prouting: Bottom of page two, the part we are working on

[10/05/16 4:45:21 pm] Gabby: I meant you took the goal straight out part

[10/05/16 4:45:31 pm] Gabby: That means you take over this part?

[10/05/16 4:47:53 pm] Sarah Prouting: I meant that I have written up a goal for this sprint. Each job card in the sprint backlog should help us to achieve the goal. The goal is not a job card, it is the reason we chose and complete job cards (for this sprint)

[10/05/16 4:48:08 pm] Sarah Prouting: Does that make more sense?
[10/05/16 5:32:44 pm] Gabby: Oh I see okay

[10/05/16 5:32:50 pm] Gabby: I thought you talked about trello
