[25/05/16 1:32:39 pm] Sarah Prouting: Wayne - can you tell us when you are available on Friday please?

[25/05/16 1:32:59 pm] Sarah Prouting: Gabby - have you managed to book an interpreter?

[25/05/16 1:33:49 pm] yi wu: From 12-5pm

[25/05/16 1:40:47 pm] Sarah Prouting: Okay and Gabby has a class from 4pm.

[25/05/16 1:41:14 pm] Sarah Prouting: So it looks like the best time to try for an interpreter is between 12 - 4pm

[25/05/16 1:42:52 pm] Sarah Prouting: If Gabby can’t get an interpreter I would like us to consider meeting in person anyway, still using Skype IM to communicate.
This has the advantage of being as face-to-face as possible so that we can point and draw explanations to each other if necessary

[25/05/16 5:46:34 pm] Sarah Prouting: Wayne - I would recommend you choose a practice to write a learning package about, and ask Gabby what tool she will recommend for it so that your learning package teaches the right tool.

[25/05/16 5:47:10 pm] Sarah Prouting: The practices are purple and in bold in the google docs report, under “Practice Guide"
