\f0\fs24 \cf0 [11/04/16 10:07:55 am] Sarah Prouting: Hi there! Are you guys online\
[11/04/16 10:12:59 am] yi wu: (rofl)\
[11/04/16 10:13:49 am] Sarah Prouting: Yay!  So we're just waiting an Gabby...\
Wayne, what's your github username?\
[11/04/16 10:15:13 am] yi wu: I haven't got GitHub, tonight i will do it\
[11/04/16 10:15:52 am] Sarah Prouting: Okay. Did you get the agenda in an email then? I sent it this morning\
[11/04/16 10:16:13 am] yi wu: When I sign in a new one I will send a count name to you\
[11/04/16 10:16:29 am] Sarah Prouting: awesome, thanks :-)\
[11/04/16 10:16:48 am] yi wu: Yes, I get the agenda\
[11/04/16 10:18:48 am] Gabby: Hi!\
[11/04/16 10:19:49 am] Sarah Prouting: Hi!\
[11/04/16 10:20:11 am] Sarah Prouting: How is everybody? Did you both have a nice Sunday?\
[11/04/16 10:21:08 am] Gabby: I am good and yes nice weekend :)\
[11/04/16 10:22:06 am] yi wu: Every weekend I got work ;(,but not too bad\
[11/04/16 10:22:41 am] Sarah Prouting: That's a lot of work... at least you're getting some cash coming in though, eh?!\
[11/04/16 10:23:21 am] Sarah Prouting: Shall we start the meeting then? It might be handy if we keep the adenda open somewhere so we can refer to it.\
[11/04/16 10:23:37 am] yi wu: (mm)\
[11/04/16 10:23:43 am] Sarah Prouting: I'll add notes in the agenda file as we go...\
[11/04/16 10:23:56 am] Gabby: sounds good\
[11/04/16 10:25:13 am] Sarah Prouting: Okay, so as the chair for the meeting (since I agreed to go first!) I will introduce the first item, like thin:\
[11/04/16 10:25:43 am] Sarah Prouting: #1 on the agenda is "Team Agreement! - what tools will we use to allocate the work.\
[11/04/16 10:26:02 am] Sarah Prouting: Has anyone had any ideas about this?\
[11/04/16 10:27:58 am] Gabby: Hmm assigning each role, in research areas? I dont sure.\
[11/04/16 10:29:30 am] Gabby: I found in an article, \
"Allocation of task (first) -\
If student A likes X and is able at X\
Then student A could do X.\
Allocation of task (second) \'96\
If student B is good at X and has not expressed a dislike of X\
Then student B could do X."\
[11/04/16 10:29:52 am] Gabby: "Suggested training needs -\
If student C likes X, but is unable at X\
Then student C could be offered tutoring in X"\
[11/04/16 10:30:31 am] Sarah Prouting: This looks really good!  Do you have a link to the article?\
[11/04/16 10:30:55 am] Gabby: yep i'll put the link here now\
[11/04/16 10:31:05 am] Gabby: http://www.networkedlearningconference.org.uk/past/nlc2008/abstracts/PDFs/Whatley_425-433.pdf\
[11/04/16 10:33:02 am] Sarah Prouting: .. having a quick look at it...\
[11/04/16 10:35:54 am] Sarah Prouting: Hmmmm... So it's saying me pick our tasks based on what we want to do, then secondly on what we don't mind doing, and then on areas we want to learn more about?\
[11/04/16 10:38:17 am] Gabby: yeah i think so. The case three will be about game, right. the report structure will be like, intro, three different research areas, positive, negative, compare/contrast and conclusion?\
[11/04/16 10:41:19 am] Sarah Prouting: Yes in a general sense I agree. \
Wayne, how do you feel about self-selecting our areas to work on - based on what each of us most wants to do?\
[11/04/16 10:43:11 am] Sarah Prouting: Wayne - are you there?!\
[11/04/16 10:44:11 am] Sarah Prouting: Hmmm, I will try texting him\
[11/04/16 10:44:53 am] Gabby: sweet lol\
[11/04/16 10:47:02 am] yi wu: still here, I'm ok with self-selecting\
[11/04/16 10:47:16 am] Sarah Prouting: cool.\
[11/04/16 10:47:37 am] Sarah Prouting: What if two people REALLY both want the same job?\
[11/04/16 10:49:20 am] Gabby: Hmm, can try discuss about those parts and compare/choose a different area? not sure.\
[11/04/16 10:51:38 am] Sarah Prouting: What about virtual rock-paper-scissors?\
The two could both send a private message with their choice to the third person in the group. The third person screen-shots the result and posts it back into this discussion.\
[11/04/16 10:52:23 am] Gabby: oh yes good idea\
[11/04/16 10:52:54 am] Sarah Prouting: Any other ideas?  What do you think Wayne?\
[11/04/16 10:54:02 am] yi wu: I agree  no problem\
[11/04/16 10:54:36 am] Sarah Prouting: There's a lot of agreeing going on, it's making me worry!!\
[11/04/16 10:54:51 am] yi wu: :$\
[11/04/16 10:55:44 am] Gabby: lol i think it's a good idea! :)\
[11/04/16 10:56:11 am] Sarah Prouting: Thanks!! :-)\
[11/04/16 10:57:10 am] Sarah Prouting: Okay then... so to finish #1 - Work allocation, we agree on choosing the parts we want to do, and then picking from what's left over. And if there's a deadlock over a particular task we'll use rock-paper-scissors to solve it?\
[11/04/16 10:57:59 am] Sarah Prouting: Shall I put something to that effect in the agreement?\
[11/04/16 10:59:35 am] Sarah Prouting: Hello?\
[11/04/16 11:00:27 am] Gabby: sorry, just reading the practices, yes this agreement sounds good,\
[11/04/16 11:02:29 am] yi wu: Okay\
[11/04/16 11:03:59 am] Sarah Prouting: great! Thanks :-) \
So that was another thing which I was thinking of as the Chair for the meeting. Even though we'd all been saying we were happy with the ideas I still made sure to get a final consensus before adding it to the agreement/agenda notes.\
[11/04/16 11:05:15 am] Gabby: Yeah need to make sure to have the final consensus, to ensure its confirm :)\
[11/04/16 11:05:27 am] Sarah Prouting: Exactly!\
[11/04/16 11:05:36 am] Sarah Prouting: And to completely round off #1 on the agenda, we think about what action items it leaves us with.\
[11/04/16 11:06:18 am] Sarah Prouting: In this case we have enough now for an agreement, which will need to be written up more formally and maybe even put into a pdf or something.\
[11/04/16 11:08:06 am] Gabby: so action items? \
\
and yes agree, all agreements should be copied off and writing into a word doc, or something.\
[11/04/16 11:09:25 am] Sarah Prouting: yeah I think that's probably the only action item. Unless someone else has one I'll move on to item 2\
[11/04/16 11:11:04 am] Gabby: hmm I see. okay, move on to item 2? or add something, wayne?\
[11/04/16 11:11:50 am] yi wu: move forward, no extra common\
[11/04/16 11:12:39 am] Sarah Prouting: great.\
#2 a) what approaches do we want to use?\
[11/04/16 11:14:51 am] Gabby: Hmm. Agile?\
[11/04/16 11:18:21 am] yi wu: Excuse me, I got exam this afternoon, I thought this is a quick meting , but looks will take longer than My expect,do you mind I leave right now? :$ .i want take more time to prepare\
[11/04/16 11:19:12 am] Sarah Prouting: So... do you want us to go ahead & make decisions without you, or to organise our next meeting?\
[11/04/16 11:20:28 am] yi wu: You just go head without me no worry, if I got any idea I will put on\
[11/04/16 11:21:43 am] Sarah Prouting: Okay. Just a note - I think that even a quick meeting will take an hour, because of the lanuages we use...\
[11/04/16 11:22:55 am] yi wu: :$.    Okay, I will remember that problem\
[11/04/16 11:23:05 am] yi wu: Sorry guys\
[11/04/16 11:23:09 am] Sarah Prouting: :-)\
[11/04/16 11:23:12 am] Gabby: :) its all good\
[11/04/16 11:23:27 am] Sarah Prouting: Gabby- are you happy to carry on for another 30mins? (and then I will have to go too!)\
[11/04/16 11:23:41 am] Gabby: yup i am happy :)\
[11/04/16 11:23:43 am] Sarah Prouting: (Bye Wayne!!)\
[11/04/16 11:25:17 am] Gabby: for the approaches, Agile or other to add?\
[11/04/16 11:25:51 am] Sarah Prouting: I think there might be a little more to it than that... Have you read that page 154?\
[11/04/16 11:26:16 am] Gabby: Am looking for it,\
