[22/05/16 3:31:33 pm] Sarah Prouting: Gabby - with regards to the practice guide - have you made any progress on this?
Would you like to recommend some scrum techniques for “Communication and Collaboration” ? For example the daily standup is a technique for communication.

[22/05/16 5:38:04 pm] Sarah Prouting: Hi Gabby - are you there?

[22/05/16 5:39:11 pm] Gabby: Hi! Here.

[22/05/16 5:39:26 pm] Gabby: Hold a min am reading above now

[22/05/16 5:48:26 pm] Sarah Prouting: What do you think about it?

[22/05/16 6:01:17 pm] Sarah Prouting: My partner has arrived home from Hastings and I have to go help unpack & do dinner now. Can we meet later tonight - will you be near the computer?

[22/05/16 6:11:39 pm] Gabby: Okay and yes. I tho we agreed on 
crystal for the practice guide. Recommend will be scrum crystal xp etc then focus on crystal for the rest of the research report?

[22/05/16 6:17:49 pm] Sarah Prouting: That’s right. How about you have a read through the things i have written about Crystal in the report? I have made some statements like: “_The Crystal methodology does not prescribe specific techniques or processes,_” hopefully that will explain that we can use techniques from other types of Agile approaches to achieve the standards which Crystal requires

[22/05/16 7:08:27 pm] Gabby: I'm now looking at the report and okay.

[22/05/16 7:15:47 pm] Gabby: I see. So I'll make a section of scrum before the crystal

[22/05/16 7:27:08 pm] Sarah Prouting: I feel as though we are not communicating very well :-/

[22/05/16 7:37:20 pm] Sarah Prouting: Image

[22/05/16 7:43:13 pm] Sarah Prouting: So that’s a picture of how it all fits together. The first part of the report was about deciding which of those APPROACHes is best for the project.
We already decided on Crystal, so let’s call that part of the project done. :-)
The next step of the report (the Practice Guide) is all about explaining the TECHNIQUES which are used by the chosen method.

[22/05/16 7:46:44 pm] Sarah Prouting: I have a new idea… what do you think about writing up the section on tools - the tool guide?
We are already using so many tools - Skype, Trello (there is also a great communication tool called ‘Slack’), git hub, team wiki, etc.  You could write on the How and Why for those tools, and I could work on the Practice Guide… since I have done the research on Crystal.

[22/05/16 7:49:54 pm] Sarah Prouting: (By the way… I can only talk tonight until 9:30pm, so that will have to be our time box)

[22/05/16 7:52:38 pm] Gabby: Oh tool guide. Sure. So Not need scrum section?

[22/05/16 7:55:33 pm] Sarah Prouting: Well… I thought our decision had been to stick with Crystal since that’s what’s been written up. Do you think you can add a scrum section AND a tool guide by Friday, or just the tool guide?

[22/05/16 7:56:19 pm] Gabby: I thought so but you say should try to add scrum so I research on it.. Well I can just remove it

[22/05/16 7:56:33 pm] Gabby: Just tool guide then

[22/05/16 7:59:52 pm] Sarah Prouting: Yeah, I’m sorry. That’s why I think we are not communicating so well, because I was meaning only some parts of scrum in parts of the Practice Guide.  Did you make notes from your research? Do you have copies of the notes??

[22/05/16 8:01:28 pm] Gabby: Yeah but I think not need to add it as its not required

[22/05/16 8:01:37 pm] Gabby: So tool guide then

[22/05/16 8:01:40 pm] Gabby: I'll try

[22/05/16 8:04:26 pm] Sarah Prouting: Do you think you could share your notes with me? I think they would be very valuable for me to see where scrum can be added to the Practice Guide… even if you sent me photos of them?

[22/05/16 8:05:25 pm] Sarah Prouting: Also.. if you post photos of the notes (or the files if they are digital) we can add them as evidence to prove you have been doing  the research. That means you can get the points for the research even if it isn’t in the report!

[22/05/16 8:06:03 pm] Gabby: Nah it's okay. I will take it as it let me

[22/05/16 8:30:57 pm] Sarah Prouting: Oh… Are you sure? It would be cool if I could use them to help with the practice guide.

[22/05/16 8:37:08 pm] Gabby: Yeah I'm sure

[22/05/16 8:37:15 pm] Gabby: It's alright

[22/05/16 8:37:22 pm] Gabby: I'll do tool guide, will try

[22/05/16 8:56:55 pm] Sarah Prouting: Okay :-)
Are you happy with that?

[22/05/16 8:57:05 pm] Sarah Prouting: With doing the tool guide?

[22/05/16 9:12:12 pm] Gabby: Yeah
