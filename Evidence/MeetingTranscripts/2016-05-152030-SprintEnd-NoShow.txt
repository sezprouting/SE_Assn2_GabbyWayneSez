[15/05/16 2:27:57 pm] Sarah Prouting: So how is everyone coming along? Remember today is the last day of the sprint which means we need to have our approach recommendation FINISHED!

[15/05/16 2:28:33 pm] Sarah Prouting: Wayne I haven’t heard from you at all - did you have a go at recording your progress offline?

[15/05/16 2:56:40 pm] Sarah Prouting: Here’s some stuff to note - Anne Philpot (SE Lecturer) said we can make up names for the project owners and the game etc, so I went ahead and invented “Saturn Games” as the name of the company we are writing the report for, and the name of the game is “Gibbous Earth”

[15/05/16 2:56:49 pm] Sarah Prouting: We can totally change them if you want.

[15/05/16 2:58:18 pm] Sarah Prouting: Also, there are a lot of relevant facts available in the discussions in AUTOnline, for example the team is expected to be at full capacity within 3-4 months, and about 40% is supposed the be developers and QA

[15/05/16 10:33:25 pm] Sarah Prouting: Just to let you know; in Trello - I have renamed the "In progress" list to "Ready for Review" because I'm uncomfortable putting my finished tasks into the "DONE" list without the both of you agreeing they are DONE.

[15/05/16 10:34:10 pm] Sarah Prouting: How are you both coming along in your research? I haven't seen any of your three questions, and there is no writing in the report.

[15/05/16 10:34:43 pm] Sarah Prouting: We need to choose a project approach to recommend - and the cut-off is TONIGHT!!!

[15/05/16 10:35:18 pm] Sarah Prouting: Since the only research I know about is Crystal, that is what I would recommend :-)
