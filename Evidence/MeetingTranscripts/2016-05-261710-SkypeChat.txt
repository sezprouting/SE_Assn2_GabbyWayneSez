[26/05/16 5:13:23 pm] Sarah Prouting: Hi Gabby

[26/05/16 5:13:43 pm] Sarah Prouting: Did you have any luck booking an interpreter?

[26/05/16 5:18:15 pm] Gabby: No

[26/05/16 6:38:26 pm] Sarah Prouting: Okay, never mind. I have booked a room in the library on level 6, Room 12. The booking is from 2pm to 3pm. I expect us all to be there so that we can conduct the team retrospective.

[26/05/16 6:39:43 pm] Sarah Prouting: The retrospective will be very similar to the retrospective which Gabby and I held during the tutorial. We will have three areas - 1) what went well, 2) what could be improved and 3) what needs changing.

I will bring bits of paper, we will have a time box and each write on the bits of paper - notes for each area on the retrospective. Then we can group them into similar themes.

[26/05/16 6:40:57 pm] Sarah Prouting: Then each of us can chose one of the three areas and type up the results into the assignment.

I will bring whiteboard markers (if Rm 12 has a whiteboard we can use it) and I'll  take pictures of the process for our evidence

[26/05/16 6:44:34 pm] Sarah Prouting: Gabby don't worry about no interpreter - we'll make sure everything is written on paper or on the computer. If you want to bring someone else with you too for company/help/support that would be awesome, because I don't want anyone to feel isolated. You are an important member of our team & your input is really important too.

[26/05/16 6:48:50 pm] Sarah Prouting: Wayne, the same goes for you - if you know someone who can help translate between mandarin and english then that could certainly help. I'm afraid I only know one person who could help me translate/interpret and he has a job so wouldn't be able to come along to give us a hand :-(
