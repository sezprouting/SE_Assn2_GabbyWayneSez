[17/05/16 9:13:19 pm] Sarah Prouting: So; at our retrospective today; Gabby and I agreed that we would change the nightly meetings to a promise to post the answers to the three questions by 10pm each night. If someone is facing obstacles it is up to the team to help out where possible.

[17/05/16 9:15:59 pm] Sarah Prouting: We haven't started our next sprint yet, and it is due to finish ON FRIDAY!

[17/05/16 9:17:19 pm] Sarah Prouting: so, what do you want to do team?
A) keep researching methods,
B) pick one out of Scrum, XP and Crystal and just move on with the next part (practice guide), or 
C) something else?

[17/05/16 9:53:44 pm] Gabby: This Friday?

[17/05/16 9:53:50 pm] Gabby: And B

[17/05/16 9:55:52 pm] Sarah Prouting: Yes that was the initial result from the calendar thing we did LAST tutorial (you had to leave for your next class :-( )

[17/05/16 9:56:14 pm] Sarah Prouting: However that doesn’t mean we can’t agree to change it.

[17/05/16 9:56:36 pm] Sarah Prouting: It’s just that we’d need to change before we started the Sprint :-)

[17/05/16 9:56:37 pm] Gabby: Ah I see sweet. Why not upload the results to google drive?

[17/05/16 9:57:02 pm] Sarah Prouting: Which results?

[17/05/16 9:57:07 pm] Gabby: Yup sure

[17/05/16 9:57:13 pm] Gabby: Last tutorial

[17/05/16 9:57:26 pm] Sarah Prouting: I think I put them in github...

[17/05/16 9:57:51 pm] Gabby: Oh GitHub? I never checked

[17/05/16 9:57:53 pm] Sarah Prouting: and I added the sprint we just finished and the next sprint to the google calendar

[17/05/16 9:58:22 pm] Gabby: Calendar? I never used it. What about pictures?

[17/05/16 9:58:42 pm] Sarah Prouting: https://github.com/sezprouting/SE_Assn2_GabbyWayneSez/tree/master/Evidence/Priorities%20and%20Plans/2016-05-10-workOverviewAndPriorities

[17/05/16 9:59:31 pm] Gabby: I'll need to use my laptop I'll check tomorrow when I can

[17/05/16 10:00:19 pm] Sarah Prouting: If you scroll up to 10 May in this conversation there is a picture of the calendar...

[17/05/16 10:01:37 pm] Gabby: Scroll up?

[17/05/16 10:01:48 pm] Gabby: Never mind I will check GitHub

[17/05/16 10:07:44 pm] Sarah Prouting: Sorry Gabby I was typing in another channel :-) I meant if you look at the history for this conversation, you should be able to see the picture of the calendar which I sent on the 10th of May. I hope that makes more sense.


[17/05/16 10:37:48 pm] Gabby: I know what you meant before

[17/05/16 10:38:14 pm] Gabby: I just can't go stroll up. I will look at GitHub instead

[17/05/16 10:40:45 pm] Sarah Prouting: Oh. Strange - I didn't know you can't scroll up. That link I posted should get you there. 
I'm in bed now, so catch you tomorrow eh? 
Good night :-)

[17/05/16 10:41:18 pm] Gabby: I don't mind anyways. Good night
