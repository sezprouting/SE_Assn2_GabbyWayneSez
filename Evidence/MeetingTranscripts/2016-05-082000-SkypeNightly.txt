[8/05/16 7:27:15 pm] Sarah Prouting: Greetings all.  A few day ago I sent out a meeting request for 7:30 tonight (now) for us to share our recommendations.
Are you both online and ready to do this?  We are nearing the end of our sprint (SPRINT ENDS TOMORROW NIGHT)

[8/05/16 8:08:05 pm] Gabby: Oh I thought that the meeting will be on 8.30?

[8/05/16 8:08:34 pm] Gabby: Or 8pm..

[8/05/16 8:08:50 pm] Gabby: Well I'm just researching on scrum now.

[8/05/16 8:09:17 pm] Sarah Prouting: Yeah the nightly "stand up is 8pm"
Did you get a meeting request for a 7:30 meeting tonight? I sent it a few days ago

[8/05/16 8:10:23 pm] Gabby: Sorry no . I haven't been updated lately.

[8/05/16 8:14:55 pm] Sarah Prouting: That's strange. It should have been sent to your email :-(

[8/05/16 8:15:09 pm] Sarah Prouting: Anyway, do you want to answer your three questions?

[8/05/16 8:16:02 pm] Gabby: I see. Oh it's still same answers as previously, actually

[8/05/16 8:16:08 pm] Gabby: Yours?

[8/05/16 8:18:17 pm] Sarah Prouting: I have pretty much complete the introduction - I was going to ask you two to review it. I am making good progress on Crystal - just have to write it up really. I intend to have that done by tomorrow's nightly.
My biggest obstacle at the moment is waiting on the product owners (Jim or Anne) to reply to my questions on AUTOnline. Until I have some clarification I won't be able to call my work DONE.

[8/05/16 8:19:06 pm] Sarah Prouting: I don't suppose you've heard from Wayne? I was hoping he would have put more effort in after his promise last Tuesday.

[8/05/16 8:19:17 pm] Sarah Prouting: ... Wayne are you there?!

[8/05/16 8:20:17 pm] Gabby: I see I have read the Google doc recently. So from where I see, when I research on scrum then I can typed up on the report or no?

[8/05/16 8:20:30 pm] Gabby: No I haven't heard anything from him lately

[8/05/16 8:20:54 pm] Sarah Prouting: I definitely think you should type up your research onto the report!!

[8/05/16 8:21:40 pm] Gabby: Okay I will try my best to do so..

[8/05/16 8:23:21 pm] Sarah Prouting: Understand that you have other assignments too, so just prioritise as you can. I hope we will be able to discuss our methods and choose one tomorrow

[8/05/16 8:24:25 pm] Sarah Prouting: I sent a meeting request for tomorrow at 2:30 - you didn't get that one either?

[8/05/16 8:25:53 pm] Gabby: Oh tomorrow at 2.30? I think I can't make it, only night..

[8/05/16 8:28:15 pm] Sarah Prouting: That's okay, 2:30 was a starting idea.  I can't do 6pm - 7:30pm because of class, and we have our nightly later on a Monday.
We need to review each other's work and agree if it is DONE or not... And finish the sprint so that we are ready for our retrospective in the tutorial on Tuesday.

[8/05/16 8:28:49 pm] Sarah Prouting: It will take a while... What time do you think we can meet to do this?

[8/05/16 8:29:09 pm] Gabby: Yeah okay, use this same time as last Monday around 9pm something?

[8/05/16 8:29:56 pm] Sarah Prouting: Okay, 9pm?

[8/05/16 8:30:17 pm] Sarah Prouting: (It will be a different meeting to the 30min nightly update)

[8/05/16 8:31:22 pm] Sarah Prouting: Oh Wait! No it won't! If the sprint is finished then we won't need to do the nightly meeting!!!
So we could start at 8:30 ?

[8/05/16 8:33:04 pm] Gabby: Okay

[8/05/16 8:34:33 pm] Sarah Prouting: Sweet. Hopefully I can get in touch with Wayne and let him know!

[8/05/16 8:34:57 pm] Sarah Prouting: Are you all good to finish scrum by then?

[8/05/16 8:35:08 pm] Sarah Prouting: Or do you want a hand?

[8/05/16 8:35:41 pm] Gabby: Great. It's okay I will try after I done with other assignment

[8/05/16 8:40:21 pm] Sarah Prouting: Okay. Just let me know if I can help :-)
I have heard back from Wayne - he is at work. I've asked him to let us know about that next time.

[8/05/16 8:40:47 pm] Sarah Prouting: Good meeting Gabby :-) Catch you tomorrow night.
And good luck with your other assignments.

[8/05/16 8:42:27 pm] Gabby: Great thanks
