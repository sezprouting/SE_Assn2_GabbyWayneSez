\f0\fs24 \cf0 [4/05/16 4:35:31 pm] Gabby: Okay I just got home and tomorrow night will be alright.\
[4/05/16 4:36:14 pm] Gabby: I can't access trello right now. So I plan to take over some tasks\
[4/05/16 4:36:40 pm] Sarah Prouting: yeah about that - I think I was wrong about the start of the report.\
[4/05/16 4:37:40 pm] Sarah Prouting: I think that first 25% is about choosing an agile methodology (or a hybrid), rather than finding solutions under those task headings.\
[4/05/16 4:38:11 pm] Gabby: Image\
[4/05/16 4:38:15 pm] Gabby: This one?\
[4/05/16 4:38:33 pm] Gabby: Yeah it's the main report\
[4/05/16 4:38:38 pm] Gabby: I assumed so\
[4/05/16 4:38:50 pm] Sarah Prouting: yeah that one\
[4/05/16 4:39:23 pm] Sarah Prouting: how did you interpret it?\
[4/05/16 4:40:10 pm] Gabby: Image\
[4/05/16 4:41:20 pm] Gabby: It say here, need to introduce the project and something which includes recommendations which will link to below like detail of recommendations in further of report\
[4/05/16 4:41:55 pm] Gabby: Which need to pick the approaches for the project on this part then can explain more in the further tasks\
[4/05/16 4:42:01 pm] Gabby: It's what I think\
[4/05/16 4:42:27 pm] Gabby: I think can put three approaches or something\
[4/05/16 4:47:03 pm] Sarah Prouting: So.. wikipedia has these methods:\
[4/05/16 4:47:12 pm] Sarah Prouting: Image\
[4/05/16 4:47:38 pm] Sarah Prouting: and these practices:\
[4/05/16 4:47:43 pm] Sarah Prouting: Image\
[4/05/16 4:48:09 pm] Sarah Prouting: So do you think that this part of the report should recommend a combination of these?\
[4/05/16 4:50:23 pm] Gabby: Yeah it's in project practice guide I assumed\
[4/05/16 4:50:55 pm] Gabby: But need to research on each approaches which match to the small group of 4\
[4/05/16 4:53:17 pm] Sarah Prouting: Noting that the small group of 4 is going to grow into a large group of 45-50\
[4/05/16 4:56:35 pm] Sarah Prouting: So\'85 taking your interpretation of this section of the report - how would you distribute the work for a sprint?\
[4/05/16 5:01:58 pm] Gabby: So .. I don't even sure about sprint .\
[4/05/16 5:06:33 pm] Sarah Prouting: Neither\
[4/05/16 5:07:31 pm] Sarah Prouting: Mane we could each research three different methods and at the end recommend one (each) then we pick a winner from the three choices?\
[4/05/16 5:07:47 pm] Sarah Prouting: "Mane" = Maybe\
[4/05/16 5:11:27 pm] Sarah Prouting: Do you think we could do that by Monday?\
[4/05/16 5:11:57 pm] Sarah Prouting: We can all write into the report as we go?\
[4/05/16 5:28:16 pm] Gabby: Yeah we could. Methods are like approaches for the project?\
[4/05/16 5:30:13 pm] Sarah Prouting: I think so... The big terms like XP, Scrum, Kanban, Crystal Clear... I think the ones in the list on that first Wikipedia screenshot\
[4/05/16 5:34:43 pm] Gabby: Okay will try\
[4/05/16 5:36:46 pm] Sarah Prouting: I wish Wayne had turned up to the meeting. I tried texting him at 4:50 but I still haven't heard from him\
[4/05/16 5:37:16 pm] Sarah Prouting: Shall we just make an executive decision to make the change?!\
[4/05/16 5:51:24 pm] Gabby: What is the changes?\
[4/05/16 5:52:26 pm] Sarah Prouting: So.. Where I made the cards with the blue labels... We would delete them, and\
[4/05/16 5:53:45 pm] Sarah Prouting: Maybe choose two or three types of agile each (different ones) and turn them into trellis cards\
[4/05/16 5:53:54 pm] Sarah Prouting: And research\
[4/05/16 5:54:03 pm] Sarah Prouting: Them.\
[4/05/16 5:54:30 pm] Sarah Prouting: Sorry, my iPad is changing my words!!\
[4/05/16 5:56:11 pm] Sarah Prouting: Image\
[4/05/16 5:56:21 pm] Sarah Prouting: These ones\
[4/05/16 5:59:58 pm] Gabby: I see\
[4/05/16 6:00:24 pm] Gabby: Okay why not next to this section\
[4/05/16 6:01:11 pm] Gabby: Not merge it into these cards\
[4/05/16 6:02:10 pm] Sarah Prouting: I\'92m not sure what you are asking.. are you suggesting we can still use the cards for this section?\
[4/05/16 6:03:04 pm] Gabby: Yeah isn't those cards come out of the report requirements?\
[4/05/16 6:05:34 pm] Sarah Prouting: We\'92ll that\'92s where I think I went wrong\'85 because one philosophy (e.g. Kanban) doesn\'92t wedge into just collaboration, or quality assurance. I think the first section is about what philosophy (agile methodology) should encompass the whole project\'85 then the next sections are how to execute (carry out) each function\
[4/05/16 6:06:49 pm] Sarah Prouting: I think I was wrong to try and split it up at the start of the report. Give me a few minutes and I will try to make an example report to show you what i mean\
[4/05/16 6:06:54 pm] Gabby: So the changes will be removed all the cards and changing into the new list of cards?\
[4/05/16 6:07:28 pm] Sarah Prouting: I think so\'85 if you agree. Give me a few minutes and I\'92ll make an example\
[4/05/16 6:07:49 pm] Gabby: What's on the list?\
[4/05/16 6:09:25 pm] Sarah Prouting: makes recommendations for suitable project approach/s. \
- Collaboration&Communication \
- RequirementsEngineering\uc0\u8232 - ProjectPlanningandTracking\
- ManagingChange \
- QualityAssurance\
[4/05/16 6:09:54 pm] Sarah Prouting: So each point is a card in trello\
[4/05/16 6:10:53 pm] Gabby: I see. \
\
Deliverable:\
\
Recommendations for project approach.\
\
Project practice guide.\
\
Project tool guide.\
\
Tool/practice learning package.\
[4/05/16 6:11:19 pm] Gabby: Details will be like \
Collaboration and communications etc\
[4/05/16 6:11:59 pm] Sarah Prouting: Hang on - let me write up this example?\
[4/05/16 6:23:26 pm] Sarah Prouting: okay, take a look at this https://docs.google.com/document/d/13yAUWeiJdkjFsim4gWN_FuhEA3h4KLe-fojO8DcJ0bc/edit?usp=sharing\
[4/05/16 6:23:57 pm] Sarah Prouting: notice that the sub-headings of:\
- Collaboration&Communication \
- RequirementsEngineering\uc0\u8232 - ProjectPlanningandTracking\
- ManagingChange \
- QualityAssurance\
[4/05/16 6:24:08 pm] Sarah Prouting: are NOT used in the first section?\
[4/05/16 6:25:28 pm] Gabby: It relates to project practice guide\
[4/05/16 6:25:44 pm] Sarah Prouting: yes. and tool guide\
[4/05/16 6:26:47 pm] Gabby: Practices use in practice guide and Tools use for supporting the practices\
[4/05/16 6:26:59 pm] Sarah Prouting: exactlly\
[4/05/16 6:27:23 pm] Gabby: After that, pick one tool or practice\
[4/05/16 6:27:41 pm] Gabby: To get depth details on it\
[4/05/16 6:28:44 pm] Sarah Prouting: I think so. That\'92s how it\'92s worded in the assignment: \'93Select one tool or practice that you have recommended and prepare a learning package \'94\
[4/05/16 6:29:07 pm] Gabby: Yeah\
[4/05/16 6:30:40 pm] Sarah Prouting: So\'85 What i had originally designed was to use those bullet points as headings in that first section, but I don\'92t think that works very well, because we wouldn\'92t choose Scrum for collaboration and Kanban for requirements engineering\'85 would we?\
[4/05/16 6:31:49 pm] Gabby: I don't sure about that but for the project case\
[4/05/16 6:31:53 pm] Gabby: It might be worked\
[4/05/16 6:32:34 pm] Gabby: And I don't get what foo is for\
[4/05/16 6:33:00 pm] Sarah Prouting: oh, sorry. Foo is a nickname for \'93anything\'94\
[4/05/16 6:33:43 pm] Gabby: Oh I see\
[4/05/16 6:35:11 pm] Sarah Prouting: okay\'85 so if you compare the headings in the report I made, and the headings in the example - which one would you rather make?\
[4/05/16 6:38:55 pm] Gabby: Heading? Like section one section two?\
[4/05/16 6:40:56 pm] Sarah Prouting: Yeah. So in the report I made first there are only headings and sub-headings\
In the example I made just now there are Headings, sub-headings and a little bit of pretend paragraph text\
[4/05/16 6:41:10 pm] Gabby: Yeah I saw\
[4/05/16 6:41:14 pm] Gabby: It's okay for now\
[4/05/16 6:41:54 pm] Sarah Prouting: but the point is the headings direct the way the report is researched and reported. I think we should do the example - you think we should keep the first one?\
[4/05/16 6:42:56 pm] Gabby: Yeah I think this report is a draft and guide us to stay on track so we could use it for now\
[4/05/16 6:43:19 pm] Gabby: We can modify it later on when we have more details on\
[4/05/16 6:44:49 pm] Sarah Prouting: Okay - fair enough!\
[4/05/16 6:45:12 pm] Sarah Prouting: So\'85 how will we decide what main agile methodology to recommend?\
[4/05/16 6:46:08 pm] Gabby: Check the project case then research on agile methodology individual then next meeting we can put out the ideas?\
[4/05/16 6:47:21 pm] Sarah Prouting: Okay. Sounds good.\
Do you think we should split up and research different ones - or all research everything?\
[4/05/16 6:50:16 pm] Gabby: Research on everything? Like all parts of report case? Or agile methodology?\
[4/05/16 6:50:44 pm] Sarah Prouting: Just for this part: \'93research on agile methodology individual\'94\
[4/05/16 6:51:30 pm] Sarah Prouting: should we pick two or three each - or all research everything? I think we are running out of time, so maybe pick different ones to research\
[4/05/16 6:51:53 pm] Sarah Prouting: and join them together on tuesday at the tutorial\
[4/05/16 6:52:11 pm] Sarah Prouting: then pick one to recommend...\
[4/05/16 6:52:15 pm] Gabby: Yeah agile one split up and what will we research on other than agile?\
[4/05/16 6:52:24 pm] Sarah Prouting: Just agile\
[4/05/16 6:52:44 pm] Gabby: Next Tuesday? I prefer do next meeting like tomorrow or Friday\
[4/05/16 6:52:47 pm] Sarah Prouting: But like - I could research Crystal and you could research XP\
[4/05/16 6:52:50 pm] Sarah Prouting: like that\
[4/05/16 6:52:55 pm] Gabby: Pick one agile to use for the rest.\
[4/05/16 6:53:14 pm] Sarah Prouting: to use for the rest of the report\
[4/05/16 6:53:40 pm] Gabby: I meant we research now for the practices of agile\
[4/05/16 6:53:54 pm] Gabby: We put out the ideas of method to recommend\
[4/05/16 6:54:01 pm] Gabby: In the next meeting\
[4/05/16 6:54:04 pm] Gabby: Like soon\
[4/05/16 6:55:30 pm] Sarah Prouting: Yes!\
So\'85 we pick one or two different methods each, and that covers lots of different methods. Then soon we put our research together and choose one to recommend.\
Then later, we use that one method to do the rest of the report?\
[4/05/16 6:56:15 pm] Sarah Prouting: We would still have our nightly meetings - but we arrange a different meeting to merge our ideas together?\
[4/05/16 6:58:57 pm] Gabby: Yeah it will be good\
[4/05/16 6:59:12 pm] Gabby: I think Sunday or Monday?\
[4/05/16 6:59:20 pm] Sarah Prouting: Sunday night?\
[4/05/16 6:59:57 pm] Sarah Prouting: We could have a retrospective either on Monday online or otherwise at the tutorial\
[4/05/16 7:04:27 pm] Gabby: Yeah Sunday or Monday or titorial\
[4/05/16 7:05:27 pm] Sarah Prouting: How about we share our findings on Sunday, choose the very final recommendation on Monday, and do the retrospective at the tutorial?\
[4/05/16 7:06:11 pm] Gabby: Yeah it will do\
[4/05/16 7:07:13 pm] Sarah Prouting: Okay - so do you have access to trello now?\
[4/05/16 7:10:44 pm] Sarah Prouting: Cos I\'92m going to pick some methods and add them to the sprint backlog in my name!\
[4/05/16 7:21:54 pm] Gabby: Yea\
[4/05/16 7:21:58 pm] Gabby: I do now\
[4/05/16 7:23:26 pm] Sarah Prouting: great! Have a look at the sprint goal and tell me what you think. Also, let me know if you want to do either of the cards which I chose :-)\
[4/05/16 7:23:40 pm] Sarah Prouting: Cos I don\'92t mind switching :-)\
[4/05/16 7:25:20 pm] Gabby: Okay sweet I'll do\
[4/05/16 7:26:04 pm] Sarah Prouting: Great! Phew!  See you in half an hour for the nightly?!}
