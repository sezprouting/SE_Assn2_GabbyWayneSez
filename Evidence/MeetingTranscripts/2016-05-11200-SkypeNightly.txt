[12/05/16 8:01:26 pm] Sarah Prouting: Hi there! Will anyone be attending our nightly meeting today?!

[12/05/16 8:14:29 pm] Sarah Prouting: Guys I’m a bit unsure about what’s happening here;
I thought we were agreed that we would have another sprint which ends on Sunday 15 May. There should be nightly “stand-up” meetings to let each other know how we’re going.
But no one has contributed… are we still running nightly meetings?

[12/05/16 8:19:46 pm] Gabby: Hi! Yeah ends on Sunday night. Not sure about nightly meeting, maybe should like three days or have to be everyday?

[12/05/16 8:23:04 pm] Sarah Prouting: Well I had an idea, which is we don't have to all be online at the same time.
The idea is that we still answer the three questions (every night), but only have to discuss/meet if there is an obstacle which needs to be resolved

[12/05/16 8:25:46 pm] Sarah Prouting: That way yi wu can have time to write his answers, and none of us are held up for too long.
But I do believe every night is important - mostly because that in what the methodology calls for. Since we are effectively a 'distributed' team communication is even more important.,

[12/05/16 8:27:08 pm] Gabby: Oh okay.

[12/05/16 8:28:20 pm] Sarah Prouting: What are your thoughts? You suggested every three days...

[12/05/16 8:32:40 pm] Gabby: Well I don't sure about that as seeing that sometimes we don't answer every night. So that makes me wonder if everyday is not working.

[12/05/16 8:38:49 pm] Sarah Prouting: It's true  that we don't answer every night. 
Is that because nightly is too difficult, or because we aren't trying hard enough?
Do you think the idea of pasting our answers in our own time will help?

[12/05/16 8:55:49 pm] Gabby: Yeah I think nightly could be too difficult as things will be happen unexpectedly in everyday

[12/05/16 9:22:19 pm] Sarah Prouting: Hmm... but don't we want to share the unexpected things so everybody is aware of the challenges of the team?

[12/05/16 9:41:45 pm] Gabby: Well yeah it will be good but not sure about Wayne

[12/05/16 9:43:18 pm] Sarah Prouting: I'm not sure either. I suggested he could type the questions during the day, and simply paste them into Skype in the evening.

[12/05/16 9:46:10 pm] Gabby: Okay if it works for him
