[3/05/16 3:04:43 pm] Sarah Prouting: Hi Wayne & Gabby!
At the end of the tutorial today we got a great answer from Jim… we can use any document system we want as long as we justify it.
The two ideas on the table are google docs and word online. I am more familiar with word online and Gabby is more familiar with google docs but I believe both are fine. What do you think Wayne?
[3/05/16 3:08:16 pm] Sarah Prouting: Advantage to these systems: Can collaboratively update and see each other’s work.
Disadvantage: If someone makes big changes - cutting/pasting/deleting/overwriting - then we lose the previous work.
Solution: Keep regular copies of our progress.
Questions: 
1 - how often should we take copies? (Nightly? Twice a day?)
2 - what format should the copies be (docx? pdf?)
[3/05/16 3:18:36 pm] Gabby: Q1: Two or three days for me.
[3/05/16 3:18:43 pm] Gabby: Q2: docx
[3/05/16 3:37:44 pm] Sarah Prouting: can we download a google doc into a docx?
[3/05/16 3:43:36 pm] Gabby: Yup
[3/05/16 3:44:02 pm] Gabby: Google doc can convert into pdf or docx or other types
[3/05/16 3:44:32 pm] Sarah Prouting: cool! sounds easy then!!
[3/05/16 3:46:37 pm] Gabby: Yeah it can be
[3/05/16 4:56:51 pm] Sarah Prouting: I will text Wayne to see if he is happy with google docs, and if he is I will try to make those headings before I go to the gym...
