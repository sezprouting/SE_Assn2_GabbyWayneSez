[23/05/16 3:39:17 pm] Sarah Prouting: Gabby I’ve just added a note (in purple) to you inside the Tools section of the report on Google docs. I’ll keep adding notes as I think of them so keep an eye on the document. Feel free to add notes in my section too.

[23/05/16 9:03:29 pm] Sarah Prouting: Hi Team; here are my answers to tonight’s three questions:
What I have done - I have added some practices which could be incorporated into the practice guide - just as bullet points at the moment.
What I will do by tomorrow night - I will start to flesh out these bullet points, probably starting with some practices for communication and collaboration.
Obstacles - Nothing specific.
