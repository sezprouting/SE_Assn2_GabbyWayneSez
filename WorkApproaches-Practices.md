**a) WHAT approaches and practices will we use in our project?**
- short daily meetings
- team communication
- short iterations 
- time-boxing
- taskboards
- delivering working software
- continuous integration

**b) HOW will we use these practices?**

_Short Daily Meetings_
We agreed these meetings would be nightly rather than daily and consist of the three scrum standup questions:
- What have you done today
- What are you doing tomorrow
- What blocks are preventing the work from getting done?
We will start by time boxnig these to 30 minutes

_Team Communication_
As per the team agreement

_Short Iterations_
The sub-sections of the Project Deliverables (these are the bullet points in the work breakdown structure) will be converted into task cards in our backlog. We will use short _sprints_ to progress our work.

_Time Boxing_
Currently, time box for a _sprint_ will be 5 days.
Time for a _nightly_ meeting will be 30 minutes.

_Task Boards_
Trello, will be used to manage the _taskboards_ and GitHub, will be used to collect the _agendas_. 
A person will take a responsible to make cards in trello, to be able to see our _progresses_ clearly and see whether it has been _completed_, make some _changes_ or not.

_Delivering Working Software_
Work will be chosen so that at the end of a _sprint_ a complete module which meets a section or subsection of the marking schedule is delivered. This means it meets the definition of done.

_Continuous Integration_
Each team member works on a git branch, and submits it to a pull request by the end of a _sprint_ so that the work can be reviewed by the rest of the team. If it is _done_ it is merged into the master, else it is re-cycled through the backlog.
